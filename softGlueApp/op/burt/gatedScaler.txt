This circuit implements four counter channels, a time base to control counting
time, an overall gate, and additional circuitry to control starting, 
stopping, and processing of the count-value records.

Requirements
------------

This circuit uses a busy record (from the busy module) and a sseq record (from
the std module), which are loaded by softGlue_convenience.db.  If these records
are not available, the circuit will still function, but the counters will not be
read immediately after the count time has elapsed, and it will not be useful to
drive the counter with a ca_put_callback(), because the callback will come
immediately, instead of coming after counting has finished.

Usage
-----

0) Connect field inputs to the counters by giving names to four field input
   bits, and writing those names also to the clock inputs for up counters 1-4.
   (As delivered, all counters count the signal named "Clock_8MHz", which is the
   name this circuit gives to the 8 MHz clock.)

1) Set the count time by writing a number, to the "N" input of DivByN-1.  The
   the timebase clock is 8 MHz, so the actual count time will be N/8e6 seconds.

2) Start the counter by writing 1 to $(P)$(H)busy1 (one of the busy records
   in the EPICS database, softGlue_convenience.db, which is loaded by the
   standard softGlue.cmd file).

3) Either wait for the count time to elapse, or abort the count by writing
   0 to $(P)$(H)busy1.

4) Read the accumulated counts from UpCntr-<n>_COUNTS, where <n> is in [1-4].

5) Gating can be done either by EPICS, or by a field input.

   To gate with EPICS, write '1' to the second input of AND-1 to enable
   counting, or '0' to disable counting.

   To gate from a field input, give the field input a signal name, and write
   that same name to the second input of AND-1.

   The time-base counter also is gated, though you can have only the counter
   channels gated by changing the "EN" input of DivByN-1 from "gatedStart" to
   "start".

Theory of operation
-------------------

Execution begins when the user writes 1 to $(P)$(H)busy1.  This record declares
itself to be busy (for the purpose of ca_put_callback()), and starts the counter
circuit by writing the value 1 to the input of BUF-1.  BUF-1 fans the signal
out, as the signal named "count", to the clock inputs of flip flops DFF2 and
DFF-4.  "count" will stay at 1 until the counters are finished counting.

	DFF-4 makes an extremely short pulse (named "clear") from the rising edge of
	"count".

	DFF-2 makes an extremely short pulse (named "abort") from the falling edge
	of "count".

"clear" zeroes the counters (UpCntr-<n>), loads the count time (i.e., the number
of clock pulses) into the time base DivByN-1, and sets DFF-1 to 1, producing the
signal named "counting".  "clear*" sets the output of DFF-3 to 1, producing the
signal "counting", which stays at 1 until it's time for the counters to stop
counting.

"counting" is sent to field output bit 17, which must actually be configured as
an output, and which will generate an interrupt on the falling edge of
"counting" (when pulse counting has finished).  The interrupt processes the
record $(P)$(H)sseq1, which causes EPICS records for all four counters to
process, reading their values so that a client can acquire them.

	You can, of course, use any field output bit for this purpose, as long as
	you configure it correctly.
	
	The only reason for using an output bit is to generate an interrupt when the
	counting is finished.
	
	The counter doesn't actually rely on the interrupt.  It's only needed to get
	the counter values read from hardware promptly.  The counters will
	eventually be read in any case, by the periodic update $(P)$(H)ReadRate. 
	But a fast client (such as the sscan record) will not want to wait for this
	periodic read, nor will it know when the read has occurred.

"counting" is sent to AND-1 to be ANDed with the user's gate signal (the second
input of AND-1), producing the signal "gatedCounting".  As delivered, the gate
signal is simply 1.  The user can gate counting off by writing 0 to the gate
signal, or the user can implement a hardware gate as described above in "Usage".

"gatedCounting" enables the counters and the time base, DivByN-1.  When the
specified number of clock pulses have been received by DivByN-1, its output,
"stopTime", goes to 1 for one clock pulse.

"stopTime" is delivered to OR-1, to be ORed with the "abort" signal mentioned
earlier.  When either "stopTime" or "abort" goes to 1, DFF-3 is cleared,
rescinding "counting", which causes all counters and the time base to cease
counting.

When "counting' goes to 0, an interrupt is generated.  The interrupt causes the
string-sequence record to process the counter-value records
($(P)$(H)UpCntr-<n>_COUNTS, where <n> is in [1-4]) so their values will be
available to be read by an EPICS client.  The string-sequence record also sets
$(P)$(H)busy1 to 0, signalling completion to EPICS.
